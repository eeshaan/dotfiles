## overview
[brew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS. In this `Brewfile`, you'll find every macOS application I use.

## usage
install brew if you haven't already

```console
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

making sure that this `Brewfile` is in your current working directory, use

```console
$ brew bundle
```

uncomment and comment lines in `Brewfile` using `#` to customize the bundle according to your needs.
